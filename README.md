# Credit-fraud-detection-system

<h3>Purpose: </h3>

This system can identify fraudulent transactions. These days the number of fraudulent transactions are increasing exponentially hence the bank and government wants to stop those fraudulent transactions and provide a safw, healthy environment for their customers. 
This system created on credit card transaction dataset that have imbalance issues: handling imbalance issues, this system can identify fraud and benign transactions using machine learning classifiers and class Imbalance techniques. 
<br/>
DataSet and problem : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
There are 3 major class imbalance techniques implemented in this work:
1. Ovesampling
2. Undesrsampling
3. OverSampling followed by Undersampling
