# Credit-fraud-detection-system

<h3>Purpose: </h3>

This system can identify fraudulent transactions in all transactions.
<br/>
These days the number of fraudulent transactions are increasing exponentially hence the bank and government wants to stop these fraudulent transactions and provide a safe, secure environment for their customers. 
This system is built on transactions of credit card dataset. 


. 
<br/>
DataSet and problem : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
There are 3 major class imbalance techniques implemented in this work:
1. Ovesampling
2. Undesrsampling
3. OverSampling followed by Undersampling
 
# Imbalanced Dataset:

## Architecture:
<b>
Architecture of Credit card fraud detection System: </b>


For building the model of this problem tha most important issue is that the dataset have class imbalance issues. 
<br/> After handling this class imbalance issues, this system will identify fraud and benign transactions in all the card transactions. 
This system will built using Machine Learning classifiers and various class Imbalance techniques.
