# Credit-fraud-detection-system
This system created on credit card transaction dataset that have imbalance issues: handling imbalance issues, this system can identify fraud and benign transactions using machine learning classifiers and class Imbalance techniques. DataSet and problem : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
There are 3 major class imbalance techniques implemented in this work:
1. Ovesampling
2. Undesrsampling
3. OverSampling followed by Undersampling
